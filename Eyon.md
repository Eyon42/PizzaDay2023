# Francesco Gentile - Fullstack Dev

I'm a fullstack developer building AI and Web3 MVPs at Bestem.dev

Currently I'm focusing mostly on working with integrations and doing R&D in Collab Notebooks about tools like langchain and LLaMA.

## Recent projects
A couple of one-two days I've been doing recently besides client work.

- [Travel activity recomendation page](https://checitybot.vercel.app/)
- [Mate NFT Tracker](https://quien-tiene-el-mate.vercel.app/)
- [AI Startup Incubator](https://mvp.bestem.dev/)

Those were done in a recent exploration to review the development process at Bestem and how we can quickly put out MVPs integrating the latest technologies. Several lessons about architecture, development practices and use of LLMs came out of that and we're implementing them in our next apps.

## Content
Whenever I give a talk or workshop I try to prepare some material and examples.
